# Getting started
There is a full readme coming soon, but the short version is:
- Everything in the admin directory can be set up on a a cloud VM (preferably Ubuntu 18.x)
- client should be run locally
- functions will be deployed to cloud functions
- cron setup is necessary
- npm install anywhere you see a package.json

*Development will be ongoing and commits will occur frequently. Check back often- as breaking changes are discovered, fixes will be pushed whenever possible.*
